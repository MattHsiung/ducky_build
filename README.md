Ducky is a real-time video and file streaming platform for software engineers to work collaboratively on projects and coding challenges. Please visit us as www.duckystream.tv to see more.

##About

Ducky provides a unique platform for code collaboration and education. Ducky combines live streaming video with a in-browser project directory that updates in real time. Streamers can stream live video of their coding projects using tools like OBS, and use the ducky-stream module CLI tool to share their project directory in real time. Users watching their channel will be able to view their entire projects code base, excluding any files that have been gitignored. 

For more information about live streaming files, check out the [ducky-stream repo](https://github.com/jmeeke02/ducky-stream).

For more on our video streaming please see the [ducky-vagrant repo](https://github.com/scoland/ducky-vagrant).

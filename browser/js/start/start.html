					<h3>Download the module!<a href="https://github.com/jmeeke02/ducky-stream"class="fa fa-github pull-right"></a></h3>

						Ducky-stream is the node module for ducky. This module allows you to stream live file updates to your channel.
						<br>
						<h3>Start streaming!</h3>
						<p>
							Run <span class="important">ducky login</span> and enter your credentials.
							The ducky module will provide you with a secret key that you can then use to stream.
						</p>
						<p>	
							Add this key as the <span class="important">stream key</span> in your video streaming application, such as <span class="important">OBS.</span>
						</p>
						<p>	
							Next run <span class="important">ducky stream</span> from the directory you want to share to begin streaming your file system.
						</p>
						<h3>Usage</h3>
						<p>
							Ducky will watch your file system from the directory you run <span class="important">ducky stream</span> in. This sends up the contents of your files to then be displayed on your channel.
							<br>
						</p>
						<span class="important">
							Ducky will not share any files that you have included in your <span class="rlyImportant">.gitignore</span>.
						</span>
						<h3>Video</h3>
						<p>
							If you're new to video streaming we recommend you head 
							<a href="https://obsproject.com/" class="important">here</a> to download OBS, which is an application made for video streaming and will get you up and running in no time!
